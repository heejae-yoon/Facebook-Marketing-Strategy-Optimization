# Facebook Marketing Strategy Optimization

## Introduction

The project, titled "Facebook Marketing Strategy Optimization," investigates the relationship between Facebook post customizations and their total reach, providing insights into the effectiveness of paid promotions, post format, and the optimal time and day for posting. We used Python and Excel for our analysis and applied several statistical methods to derive our conclusions.

## Repository Contents

1. **Project Report**: The comprehensive report detailing the full project, including the methodology, analysis, and recommendations based on the findings.
2. **ANCOVA - Day of Week & Time of Day Code**: Python code to analyze the combined effects of day and time on total post reach using ANCOVA.
3. **ANCOVA - Post Type Code**: Code that performs ANCOVA to study the impact of post type (photo, status, link, or video) on total reach.
4. **ANOVA - Day of Week Code**: ANOVA analysis examining how the day of the week influences post reach.
5. **ANOVA - Time of Day Code**: ANOVA analysis to investigate whether the time of day affects post reach.
6. **T-Test - Promotion Status Code**: T-test analysis to determine the difference in post reach between paid and unpaid promotion statuses.

## Dataset Description

The dataset used in this project consists of Facebook post data from a cosmetics brand for the year 2014. It contains 500 rows after removing confidential data. Key performance indicators (KPIs) include the post type (photo, status, link, or video), promotion status (paid or unpaid), day and time of posting, and the total reach of the post. The data was sourced from the UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository.

## Summary of Findings

1. **Promotion Status**: Paid promotions significantly increase post reach. A T-test revealed a statistically significant difference between the reach of paid and unpaid promotions, suggesting that investing in paid promotions can lead to higher visibility.
   
2. **Post Type**: Our analysis showed that videos generate higher reach compared to other post types (photos, statuses, and links). While photos and statuses generally perform well, video posts stood out as the most effective format for increasing reach.

3. **Time of Day**: Contrary to expectations, the time of day showed no statistically significant impact on post reach. This result challenges common marketing strategies focused on posting at specific times for higher engagement.

4. **Day of the Week**: Similar to the time of day, the day of the week also did not significantly influence post reach in our analysis. However, businesses might want to focus on other factors such as post type and promotion strategy to maximize reach.

## Conclusion

This project provides actionable insights for businesses aiming to optimize their Facebook marketing strategies. By focusing on paid promotions and video content, companies can maximize post reach. Despite previous research suggesting the importance of posting on certain days and times, our analysis suggests that businesses should prioritize content over scheduling.
